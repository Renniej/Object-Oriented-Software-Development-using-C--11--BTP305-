Size_T is similar to a unsigned int which makes sense if your taking the size of an object there is no need to
have it be a negative number.  

Unsigned ints use half the space because they do not care about values under 0;

Move constructor is similar to a copy constructor except your shallow copying and then cutting the copied data from
its parent object.

&& = object close to death
