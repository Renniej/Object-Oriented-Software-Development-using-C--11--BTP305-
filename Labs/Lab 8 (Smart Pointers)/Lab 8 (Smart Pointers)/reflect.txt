Shared pointer has something akin to a counter that keeps count to how many objects are using it, once that pointer hits 0 it handles it's own deallocation
Unique pointer only last for the scope it is in.  It can not be copied but it can switch ownership by using the move operator.

weak pointers are shared pointers except they don't add to the static counter.  This is usually done to avoid ownership of the pointer. 

P.S: I've done all the previous workshops ):
